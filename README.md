## Powered by [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), Cookiecutter Click generates boilerplate for production-ready [command-line interface (CLI)](http://click.pocoo.org/5/) applications.

## Features

The project you create from this template has a few features to be aware of
including:

* A [Click](http://click.pocoo.org/5/) application to get you going
* [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) unit tests
* A documentation project based on
  [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html).

## Usage

Let's pretend you want to create a CLI tool called "redditcli". Rather than
using standard lib argparse and then editing mundane details to include your
basic cli tool configuration that always get forgotten until the worst possible
moment, get cookiecutter to do all the work.

First, get Cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome:

```bash
pip3 install cookiecutter>=1.4.0
```

Then, run it against this repo:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/patdaburu/cookiecutter-click
```

You'll be asked a few various questions regarding the configuration of
your CLI tool.

```

Next, enter the project and take a look around:

```bash
cd demo_cli/
source venv/bin/activate
demo --help
ls -a
```

Finally, create a git repo and push it:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of demo CLI"
git remote add origin git@github.com:vladdoster/demo_cli.git
git push -u origin main
```

## `make` Targets

The template contains a cookiecutter [post-generate
hook](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/hooks.html) that
will attempt to do the following using targets in the project's
[Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/):

You may want to go about this differently according to your processes, but if
you want to create a virtual environment for the project, install the
dependencies, and set up the comman-line application, you can use the `make`
targets defined in the project like so.

There are several other `make` targets so have a look at the `Makefile` if
you're interested.

```bash
cd <project-name>
make venv
make install
make build
```

## Run the Command-Line App

If you have performed the steps above, you should now be able to run the
application by the project name.

```bash
<project-name> --help
```

If you get the template help message, you're ready to start building.
