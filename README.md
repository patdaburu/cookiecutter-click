Powered by [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), Cookiecutter Click is a framework for jumpstarting production-ready [command-line interface (CLI)](http://click.pocoo.org/5/) projects quickly.

## Features

The project you create from this template has a few features to be aware of including:

* A [Click](http://click.pocoo.org/5/) application to get you going
* [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) unit tests
* A documentation project based on [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html).

## Getting Started

### Usage

Let's pretend you want to create a CLI tool called "redditcli". Rather than using standard lib argparse and then editing mundane details to include your basic cli tool configuration that always get forgotten until the worst possible moment, get cookiecutter to do all the work.

First, get Cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome:

`$ pip install "cookiecutter>=1.4.0"`

Now run it against this repo:

`$ cookiecutter https://github.com/patdaburu/cookiecutter-click`

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a cli tool will be created for you.

Warning: After this point, change 'Vlad Doster', 'vladdoster', etc to your own information.

Answer the prompts with your own desired options. For example:

Choose from 1,2 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) [1]: 1
github_user [my_github_user]: vladdoster
```

Enter the project and take a look around:

```
$ cd reddit_cli/
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ reddit_cli --help
$ ls
```

Create a git repo and push it there:
```
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "first awesome commit"
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:vladdoster/reddit_cli.git
$ git push -u origin master
```  

#### Run the `make` Targets

The template contains a cookiecutter [post-generate hook](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/hooks.html) that will attempt to do the following using targets in the project's [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/):

You may want to go about this differently according to your processes, but if you want to create a virtual environment for the project, install the dependencies, and set up the comman-line application, you can use the `make` targets defined in the project like so.

There are several other `make` targets so have a look at the `Makefile` if you're interested.

```bash
cd <project-name>
make venv
make install
make build
```

#### Run the Command-Line App

If you have performed the steps above, you should now be able to run the application by the project name.

```bash
<project-name> --help
```

If you get the template help message, you're ready to start building.
